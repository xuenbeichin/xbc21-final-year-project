# Modelling LSD Effects on Neurovascular Parameters in Resting-State fMRI: A Comparison of Physiological and Spectral Dynamic Causal Approaches

## Final Year Project - Bay Chin, Imperial College London

Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) provides a biophysical framework for inferring neural and vascular processes from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). This study compares two DCM variants—Physiological DCM (P-DCM), which models neurovascular coupling using stochastic differential equations in the time domain, and Spectral DCM (spDCM), which estimates effective connectivity from cross-spectral densities in the frequency domain—under placebo and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) conditions. Analyses focused on power spectral densities of individual brain regions to characterise local signal dynamics. 

Both models were applied to rs-fMRI data parcellated into 100 cortical regions. P-DCM more accurately captured the spectral complexity of empirical BOLD signals, yielding significantly lower normalised mean squared error than spDCM. While P-DCM required greater computational resources, it produced more stable parameter estimates across subjects and conditions. These advantages persisted under LSD, a condition known to alter neuronal and vascular function, whereas spDCM showed reduced fit quality and greater variability. Despite modelling the same data, parameter estimates from the two models were uncorrelated, reflecting differences in computational architecture. 

Although paired $t$-tests did not yield significant results after correction for multiple comparisons, two cluster-based permutation tests—univariate and multidimensional—identified significant LSD-related changes in P-DCM parameters. These included spatially coherent alterations in neurovascular gain, mean transit time, spectral slope of endogenous fluctuations, and excitatory self-inhibition, primarily in visual, salience, and default mode networks. One significant cluster was also observed in spDCM for phase-based connectivity within the default mode network. These findings highlight the impact of modelling approach on sensitivity to physiological changes in resting-state brain dynamics.
